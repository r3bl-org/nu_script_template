# nu_script_template

This is a template repo that can be used to manage Rust projects. The idea is to use
nushell and this script to be a replacement for justfile. The advantage of nushell is that
it is cross platform and works seamlessly on macOS, Linux and Windows. And is built
entirely in Rust. So it is easy to get this up and running on a new machine on any OS, as
long as it supports the Rust toolchain.
